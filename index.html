            <strong>Upper Arm</strong>
  The upper arm includes the shoulder as well as the area between the shoulder and elbow joint. The bones of the upper arm include the
  <strong>Scapula : </strong>The scapula is also called the shoulder blade. It’s a triangle-shaped flat bone that’s connected to the body by mostly muscle
  <strong>Clavicle : </strong> The clavicle is also called the collarbone. Like the scapula, it attaches the arm to the torso. It also helps to distribute force
  <strong>Humerus : </strong>The humerus is a long bone in the upper arm. It’s located between the scapula and the elbow joint. Many muscles and ligaments.
  The upper arm also contains several joints, including the:

            <strong>Forearm</strong>
  The forearm is the area between the elbow joint and the wrist. Its two major bones are the radius and the ulna:
  <strong>Radius : </strong>The radius is located on the side of the forearm closest to the thumb. It twists around the ulna and can change its position depending
  <strong>Ulna : </strong>The ulna runs parallel to the radius. It’s on the side of the forearm that’s closest to the pinky finger. Unlike the radius, the ulna is stationary and does

            <strong>Hand</strong>
  <strong>FIngers : </strong>Digits that extend from the palm of the hand, the fingers make it possible for humans to grip the smallest of objects.
  <strong>Palm : </strong>This is the bottom of the body of the hand.
  <strong>Back :</strong> The back of the hand shows the dorsal venous network, a web of veins.
  <strong>Wrist : </strong>The connection point between the arm and the hand, the wrist enables hand movements.

              <strong>Pectoralis Major</strong>
  The pectoralis major is the most superficial muscle in the pectoral region. It is large and fan shaped, and is composed of a sternal head and a clavicular head:
  <strong>Clavicular head-</strong> originates from the anterior surface of the medial clavicle.
  <strong>Sternocostal head-</strong> originates from the anterior surface of the sternum, the superior six costal cartilages and the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle.
  The distal attachment of both heads is onto the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus.
  Function: Adducts and medially rotates the upper limb and draws the scapula anteroinferiorly. The clavicular head also acts individually to flex the upper limb.
  Innervation: Lateral and medial pectoral nerves.

              <strong>Pectoralis Minor</strong>
  The pectoralis minor lies underneath its larger counterpart muscle, pectoralis major. Both muscles form part of the anterior wall of the axilla region.
  Attachments: Originates from the 3rd-5th ribs and inserts into the coracoid process of the scapula.
  Function: Stabilises the scapula by drawing it anteroinferiorly against the thoracic wall.
  Innervation: Medial pectoral nerve.
